This article describes potential additions to Federation 2 that are under consideration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **These additions aren't included in the Federation 2 alpha!** All of the features described in this article are subject to change or removal from the full release of Federation 2.

## Ownership directives

Federation 2 provides more flexible schema composition compared to Federation 1, but sometimes you _want_ to enforce a single source of truth for a particular type or field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">‚ùå</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Dog {
  breed: String! @final
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Dog {
  breed: String! # Can't define!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Federation 2 will support a collection of directives (such as `@final` shown above) that enable you to enforce this single source of truth.

For details, see [Federated ownership directives](../federated-types/restricting-types-fields/).

## Changes to `Query` and `Mutation` types

_By default_ in Federation 2, each subgraph's root `Query` and `Mutation` types must define _unique fields_. This means that exactly one subgraph is responsible for resolving a particular field of one of these types:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>
<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Query {
  movies: [Movie!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

You'll be able to override this enforcement with the [`@shared` directive](../federated-types/restricting-types-fields/#shared):

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  books: [Book!]! @shared
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Query {
  books: [Book] @shared
  movies: [Movie!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Now, either subgraph can resolve `Query.books`. The return types of these shared fields can even vary in the same ways as [other shared types](./new-in-federation-2/#valid-field-differences-between-subgraphs) (nullability and lists).

The `@shared` directive is required here as a protective measure: it's often an _unintended error_ for multiple subgraphs to resolve the same root field.


## Entity changes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **These changes to entities are under consideration.** Currently, Federation 1 entity definitions behave as expected in Federation 2.

In Federation 1, an [entity](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/) is an object type that _originates_ in a single subgraph. Other subgraphs can then _extend_ that entity with additional fields:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 1</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
# (Originating)
type Book @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
# (Extending)
extend type Book @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The originating subgraph is responsible for [resolving references](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/#resolving) to the entity that are provided by extending subgraphs.

In Federation 2, entities will no longer "originate" in a particular subgraph. Let's look at how this changes things.

### New syntax

Here are the `Book` entity definitions above, updated for Federation 2:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Book @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Book @entity {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Note the following changes:

* A new `@entity` directive is applied to the `Book` type in each subgraph.
* Subgraph B no longer `extend`s the `Book` type or declares a `@key`.
* Subgraph B no longer applies the `@external` directive to the `Book.id` field.

Each of these changes is described in further detail below.

### The `@entity` directive

In Federation 2, entity definitions will require the `@entity` directive:

```graphql{1}
type Book @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

This directive is required in every subgraph that defines the entity.

##### But Federation 1 entity definitions don't use `@entity`! Are they still valid in Federation 2?
**Yes.** In Federation 2, _any_ object type can have a `@key`, regardless of whether it's an entity. This enables the subgraph to [resolve references](../entities/#resolving) to that type.

Your Federation 1 entities aren't _technically_ entities in Federation 2 _unless_ you add the `@entity` directive, but they _mostly_ behave as you'd expect.


##### So what does the `@entity` directive actually do?

Initially, it will do one thing: designate every field of the object type as **final**. This means that if any subgraph defines a particular entity field (_besides_ a `@key` field), no _other_ subgraph can define or resolve that _same_ field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">‚ùå</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph A
type Book @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! # Valid duplicate (key field)
  title: String! # ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid duplicate!
}
```

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph B
type Book @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! # Valid duplicate (key field)
  title: String! # ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid duplicate!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> You can disable this "single source of truth" behavior with the [`@shared` directive](../federated-types/restricting-types-fields/#shared).

If an object type has a `@key` but _isn't_ marked with `@entity`, then multiple subgraphs can define and resolve the same fields for that type. If the `Book` type above were _not_ marked with `@entity`, the two subgraph schemas above would be valid.


### Changes to `@key`

In Federation 1, an entity requires a [`@key` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/#defining) in every subgraph that defines it:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 1</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Originating subgraph
type Book @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Extending subgraph
extend type Book @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

* In the originating subgraph, `@key` lists all of the entity's supported primary keys.
* In each extending subgraph, `@key` indicates _which_ supported primary key the subgraph uses to resolve its references.

In Federation 2, the `@key` directive does _not_ indicate whether a type is an entity. Instead, it indicates whether the current subgraph is capable of [resolving references](../entities/#resolving) to the type:

* If a subgraph _can_ resolve references to an entity, it uses `@key` to define the entity's supported primary keys.
* If a subgraph _can't_ resolve references to an entity, it _doesn't use `@key` at all._

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
# (Can resolve references)
type Book @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
# (Can't resolve references)
type Book @entity {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>
