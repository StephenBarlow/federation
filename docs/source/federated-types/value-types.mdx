In Apollo Federation, a **value type** is any type that's defined in multiple subgraphs but _isn't_ an [entity](../entities/). In the following example, both `Position` and `Color` are value types:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}

enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}

enum Color {
  CYAN
  MAGENTA
  YELLOW
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> As this example shows, a value type's definition can differ between subgraphs in Federation 2. This is _not_ true in Federation 1.
>
> Whenever a value type definition varies in a valid way, composition generates _warnings_, but not _errors_.

This article describes how to define value types in a federated graph, along with scenarios where value type definitions can [break composition](./composition/#breaking-composition).

## Objects

The fields of an object value type can differ between subgraphs in _certain ways:_

* A field's return type can vary in nullability (`Int` vs. `Int!`).
    * A field's return type _can't_ vary in its core type (`Int` vs. `String`) or in whether it returns a list (`Int` vs. `[Int]`).
* A field can be _omitted_ from a subgraph entirely if that field is always **resolvable**.

See the following subsections for details.

### Varying field return types

Let's say two subgraphs both define an `Event` object type with a `timestamp` field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Event {
  timestamp: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Event {
  timestamp: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph A's `timestamp` returns an `Int`, and Subgraph B's returns a `String`. **This is invalid.** When composition attempts to generate an `Event` type for the supergraph schema, it fails due to an unresolvable conflict between the two `timestamp` definitions.

Next, look at these varying definitions for the `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The `x` and `y` fields are _non-nullable_ in subgraph A, but they're _nullable_ in subgraph B. **This is valid!** Composition recognizes that it can use the following definition for `Position` in the supergraph schema:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

This definition works for querying Subgraph A, because Subgraph A's definition is _more restrictive_ than this (a non-nullable value is always valid for a nullable field). In this case, composition **coerces** Subgraph A's `Position` fields to satisfy the reduced restrictiveness of Subgraph B.

> Note that Subgraph A's actual subgraph schema is _not_ modified. Within Subgraph A, `x` and `y` remain non-nullable.

### Omitting fields

Look at these two definitions of a `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph B defines a `z` field, but Subgraph A doesn't. In this case, when composition generates the `Position` type for the supergraph schema, it includes all three fields:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>


**This definition works for Subgraph B, but it presents a problem for Subgraph A.** Let's say Subgraph A defines the following `Query` type:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  currentPosition: Position!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

According to the hypothetical supergraph schema, the following query is valid against the supergraph:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query GetCurrentPosition {
  currentPosition {
    x
    y
    z # ⚠️ Unresolvable! ⚠️
  }
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

And here's the problem: if Subgraph B _doesn't_ define `Query.currentPosition`, this query _must_ be executed on Subgraph A. But Subgraph A is missing the `Position.z` field, so that field is **unresolvable**!

**Composition recognizes this potential problem, and it fails with an error.** So how do we fix it? Check out [Solutions for unresolvable fields](./composition/#solutions-for-unresolvable-fields).

## Enums and unions

In Federation 2, enum and union value type definitions can differ between subgraphs:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
union Media = Book | Movie

enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
union Media = Book | Podcast

enum Color {
  CYAN
  MAGENTA
  YELLOW
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Composition logic _merges_ these definitions in your supergraph schema:

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
union Media = Book | Movie | Podcast

enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
  CYAN
  MAGENTA
  YELLOW
}
```

This can be useful when different subgraphs are responsible for different subsets of a particular set of related types or values.
