title: Federation-specific GraphQL directives
---

Apollo Federation defines a collection of **directives** that you use in your subgraph schemas to enable certain features.

## Importing directives

To use federated directives in a subgraph schema, that schema must include an `extend schema` definition with the following shape:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

The `import` array must include whichever federated directives your subgraph schema uses. The example above imports the `@key` and `@shareable` directives.

## `@key`

Designates an object type as an [entity](../entities/).

**Valid locations:** Object type definitions

```graphql {1}
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
  
<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

`String`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** A comma-separated list of field names that contribute to the entity's primary key.

</td>
</tr>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `resolvable`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `false`, informs the gateway that this subgraph _can't_ resolve fields of this entity besides `@key` fields. Include this when [referencing an entity without contributing fields](../entities/#referencing-an-entity-without-contributing-fields).

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## `@shareable`

Indicates that an object type's field can be resolved by multiple subgraphs (by default, each field can be resolved by only one subgraph).

**Valid locations:** Field definitions, Object type definitions

```graphql {2-3}
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```

If applied to an object type definition, _all_ of that type's fields are considered `@shareable`:

```graphql {1}
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```
